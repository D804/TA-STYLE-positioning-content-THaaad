        <p class="paragraph">In our urban and suburban houses what should we do wrNout cats, In our <br>
            stting or bedrooms, our libraries, in our krtchens and storerooms, our farms,<br>
             bams, and nckyards, in our docks, our granaries, our ships, and our<br>
             wharves, in our corn markets, meat markers, and other places too numerous <br>
              to mentron, how useful they are! In our ships, however, the rats oft .<br>
               them at defiance still they are of great service. <br>
               
               How wonderfully patent is the cat when watching for rats or mice, awaiting <br>
               their egress from their place of refuge or Nat which is their home! How well <br>
               Shakespeare in Pericles, Act III., descnbes this keen attention of the cat to <br>
               its natural pursuit!<br>
                The cat with eyene of burning coal, Now crouches from (before) the mouse, hole. <br>

            A slight rustle, and the NNW, comes for, a quick, sharp, resolute motion,<br>
             and the cat has proved Its usefulness. Let any one have a plague of rats and mice,<br>
              as I once had, and let Nem be delivered therefrom by cats, as I was, and they will have a laerng and kind regard for then </p>
