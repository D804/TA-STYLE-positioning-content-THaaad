                   The web is abuzz about GDPR and it's something that website owners cannot ignore. While GDPR is focused on websites servicing the EU, in reality, virtually any website
                  anywhere in the world needs to be concerned about this ruling because so many of us cater to people worldwide. The struggle with WordPress is not the implementation
                  but WordPress' user base. While WordPress provides superior CMS support for users from solopreneurs to enterprise organizations, the vast majority of WordPress' ...

            <p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer
                  took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
